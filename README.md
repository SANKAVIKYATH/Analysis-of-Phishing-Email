# Analysis-of-Phishing-Email
As a part of EthicalHackingMegaWorkshop, I have learnt about OSINT(Open Source Intelligence) tools which are useful for various cyber crime analysis
There are various kind of OSINT tools based on image, email address, domain, username, phone no and GeOSINT, some of them are:
1. Maltego
2. Spiderfoot
3. Google Dork
4. Social Engineering Toolkit
5. FLickr
6. HaveIBeenPwned
7. WhatsMyName
8. UrlScan.io
9. Truecaller
10. Google Maps
Note: The complete project is done in the Kali-Linux Environment.
In the project, I have installed maltego and various transforms inside it which are useful for investigating phishing emails.
Then I have taken Phishing Email and copied its email address into the maltego and applied various transforms on it, I find that the email is responsible for data breach, a sandbox environment(Any Run) defined it as a phishing email containing malware associated links which would take your confidential data and may also damage the system, when you click on it.
A Detailed Report(Phishing Email Report) is published, go through it to know about the complete analysis of the phishing email and furthur analysis could be done for each and every datapoint in the image(Phishing Email).
